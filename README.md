# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. The game is designed to run on a Linux-like environment, and compatibility with Windows will be added soon.

## Installation
To run the game, first make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Clone or download this repository to your local machine, navigate to the directory where the game is installed and execute the 'TicTacToe.py' file using the following command:

```
python3 TicTacToe.py
```

## Usage
To place a mark on the game board, enter a number between 1 and 9 corresponding to the position on the board where you want to place your mark. The game is easy to use and should be self-explanatory.

## Update
To update the game to the latest version, make sure you have Git installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using the following command:

```
sudo apt install git
```

Once you have Git installed, navigate to the directory where the game is installed and execute the 'Update.sh' script using the following command:

```
